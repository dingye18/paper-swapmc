\begin{abstract}
Water molecules within and around the binding cavity can significantly influence the binding affinity of ligands. 
Proper sampling of these water molecules ensures that their contributions to the free energy landscape are accurately accounted for. 
In the pursuit of more accurate binding free energy calculations, we have developed a novel Swap Monte Carlo (SwapMC) method specifically designed for cavity water sampling. 
The SwapMC method aims to enhance the sampling efficiency by facilitating the movement of water molecules in and out of the protein cavity, thereby ensuring a comprehensive exploration of water distributions. 
By leveraging GPU power to perform Monte Carlo moves for water molecules in parallel across multiple sites, and integrating SwapMC with NPT simulations within the Uni-FEP framework, 
we have observed significant improvements in the accuracy of relative binding free energy calculations, all while maintaining computational efficiency. 
Our results demonstrate that SwapMC achieves performance comparable to Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) methods in water-related test cases, offering a robust and efficient alternative for addressing the challenges associated with cavity water sampling in computational chemistry. 
%Furthermore, we have extended the SwapMC scheme to sample the distribution of ions in DNA/RNA simulations, 
%broadening the applicability of this method to a wider range of biomolecular systems and enhancing the accuracy of ion-related free energy calculations.

\section{Introduction}

\section{Method}
\subsection{Workflow of the Swap Monte Carlo}
SwapMC was designed to exchange water molecules in and out of the protein cavity during FEP calculations, Fig.~\ref{fig:scheme} B.
The cavity region is defined as a spherical space centered at the geometric center of the ligand coordinates\cite{ben2021fast}, $R^{in}$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:scheme}.
The radius is half the maximum intra-atomic distance within the ligands, plus an additional 0.3 nanometers for buffer.
All other areas of the simulation box are considered outside this spherical cavity and will be referred to as $R^{out}$ space hereafter, Fig.~\ref{fig:scheme} A.
Thus, the SwapMC algorithm workflow consists of these steps:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Randomly decide the exchange direction, ensuring an equal chance of moving water in or out of the cavity.
  \item A water molecule $i$ is chosen for deletion from the source region with the probability defined in Eq.~\ref{eq:selection_probability}. 
    Where $u_i$ represents the interaction energy of water molecule $i$ with other atoms in the simulation box. 
    $N_{src}$ denotes the number of exchangeable water molecules in the source region. A higher $u_i$ increases the likelihood of a molecule being selected.
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:selection_probability}
     p_i = \frac{e^{u_i}}{\sum^{N_{src}}_k{e^{u_k}}} \tag{1}    
  \end{equation}
  \item Uniform sampling the potential insertion sites over the destination region.
  \item The combination of the sampled sites with 60 orientations of water molecule results in 18,000 possible insertion conformations.
  \item Evaluate the interaction energy for each of the 18,000 water molecules in the simulated system, denoted as $u_j$.
  \item Sequentially iterate over these $u_j$ values, and calculate the acceptance ratio using $u_i$ and $u_j$, determine if the conformation is acceptable. If it is, terminate this iteration.
  \item Replace the deleted water positions by the accepted conformation coordinates and set this water molecule's velocity to zero.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Detailed Balance in Swap Monte Carlo}
In the Monte Carlo algorithm, the acceptance ratio $A_{S_i, S_j}$ between two states $S_i$ and $S_j$ must satisfy detailed balance:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:acceptance_ratio}
\frac{g_{S_i,S_j} A_{S_i,S_j}}{g_{S_j,S_i} A_{S_j,S_i}}=\frac{P_{S_j}}{P_{S_i}}  
\end{equation}

Where $P_{S_j}$ and $P_{S_i}$ represent the equilibrium probabilities of states $S_j$ and $S_i$, respectively. 
The terms $g_{S_i, S_j}$ and $g_{S_j,S_i}$ denote the selection probabilities for transforming state $S_i$ to state $S_j$, and vice versa.

Rewrite the Eq.~\ref{eq:acceptance_ratio} in terms of the acceptance ratio $A_{S_i,S_j}$ between two states $S_i$ and $S_j$:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:acceptance_ratio2}
\frac{A_{S_i,S_j}}{A_{S_j,S_i}}=\frac{g_{S_j,S_i} P_{S_j}}{g_{S_i,S_j} P_{S_i}}
\end{equation}

According to the Metropolis criteria, in simulations, the acceptance ratio for transforming state $`i`$ to state $`j`$, denoted as $`A_{ij}`$, is defined as:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:acceptance_ratio3}
A_{i j}=\min \left\{1, \frac{g_{j i} P_j}{g_{i j} P_i}\right\} \tag{4}
\end{equation}
